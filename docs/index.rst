UCSC Spectral Pipeline documentation
====================================

Welcome. This is the 0.1 version of a quicklook spectral reduction pipeline.
It has been tested extensively on Kast and LRIS spectral images
(SOAR still in development).

The pipeline is a collection of python scripts (pre_reduction_dev.py,
QUICKLOOK.py, and cal.py), utilising an implementation of IRAF called,
not surprisingly, pyRAF. It is heavily influenced from Stefano Valenti's work
on similar pipelines for NNT (EFOSC) and LCO (FLOYDS) pipelines.
