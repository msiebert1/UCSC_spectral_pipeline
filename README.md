UCSC Spectral Reduction Pipeline
================================

This is the 0.1 version of a quicklook spectral reduction pipeline. It has been tested extensively on Kast and LRIS spectral images (SOAR still in development). 

The pipeline is a collection of python scripts (pre_reduction_dev.py, QUICKLOOK.py, and cal.py), utilising an implementation of IRAF called, not surprisingly, pyRAF. It is heavily influenced from Stefano Valenti's work on similar pipelines for NNT (EFOSC) and LCO (FLOYDS) pipelines.
